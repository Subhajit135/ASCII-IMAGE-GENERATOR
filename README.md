# ASCII-IMAGE-GENERATOR
ASCII arts are always been one of my favorite art. So I created this python script which take image as input and generate an ASCII art of that equivalent image.

Use command line code to upload the image.
$python "ASCII_IMAGE_GENERATOR.py" --file <folder_name>/<file_name> --cols <integer value>
